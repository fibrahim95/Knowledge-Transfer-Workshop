# Knowledge-Transfer-Workshop

Hi Everyone!

In this GitHub, we provided the guidelines the installation of Anaconda and Jupyter-Notebook on VS Code. Please read carefully and do installation before the day workshop start, so we can avoid the technical stuff. Before we proceed to basic python and machine learning examples, we setting up the conda environment with Python and some libraries are needed in this workshop. Hope you enjoy this workshop.
